zark city



If I get custom plastic cards, do something like the badger deck
coins with ancient chinese artwork
cups with grecian artwork etc. other ancient cultures. pyramids and heiroglyphs?

alterantively, hearts=animal club=plant, spade=fungus, diamond is mineral or protist or robot or something. Then use ernest haenckel style prints.ooh or i could paint some watercolor images of the 4 kingdoms
A J C Q K :
Animal: Tardigrade, starfish, 
Plant: fern pine flower succulent
fungus: fairy ring, morel, that ancient giant fungus doober
elemental (ring/triangle/something): fire,   
And 6 jokers, one for each pairing.  
pheonix = elemental animal wood = elemental plant pile o dirt for fungus? fairy ring
infected insect, lichen, 



What if all thirteen animals?
A - tardigrade(best or worst, depends on who you ask). Krill would work here too.
