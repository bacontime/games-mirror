## Mario Kart Variant

This is a tweaked version of [these rules.](https://geekorthodoxy.com/downloads/). I've removed the special items, and generally changed the powerups to be more similar to the original Gaslands Ruleset.

### Activation Steps

(These are specific to the Mario Kart variant)

1. **Movement**
    1. Select Manuever Template
    2. Place Manuever Template
    3. Roll Skid Dice (up to handling score)
        - Optionally **Push It**: reroll dice and gain +1 Hazard
    4. Apply Shifts results
    5. Gain Hazard from other results
    5. Resolve Slide
    6. Move Kart (check for collisions)
    7. Resolve Spin (up to 90°)
2. **Item Attack**: You may use offensive items during this step if you have any.
    1. Check for distraction
    1. Declare Target
    2. Check range, LoS, and cover
    3. Roll Attack Dice
        - 4 and 5s hit
        - 6s double hit
    3. Defender rolls Evade Dice equal to their current Gear
        - Each 6 cancels a hit
    5. Any uncancelled hits give Hazard to the defender.
3. **Wipeout**: If *any* kart has at least 6 Hazard, it wipes out:
    1. Reduce its Gear to 1
    2. Remove all its Hazard
    3. Randomly orient the kart
    
### Collisions

If any part of a kart's movement brings it into contact with another obstacle, whether it be a kart or a wall:

1. Stop the kart at the point of first contact
2. Both the kart and the obstacle declare "Smash" or "Evade"
    - If the Obstacle is a wall, it always declares "Smash"
3. Each party that declares "Smash" rolls Attack Dice (see chart below for how many to roll):
    - 4 and 5s hit
    - 6s double hit
4. Each party that declares "Evade" rolls Evade Dice equal to their current Gear:
    - Each 6 cancels a hit
5. Any uncancelled hits give Hazard
6. All karts involve must gain at least 1 Hazard
   - This happens even if both karts declare "Evade"
   
### Smash Attack Dice

Orientation | Number of Atk Dice
---|---
Head-on| **Sum** of Gears
T-bone or Sideswipe | Attacker's current Gear
Tailgate| **Difference** between Gears

Also note that weight differences modify the number of attack dice:

Attacker is | Change in Atk Dice
---|---
1 class heavier | +1 Smash Atk Dice
2 class heavier | +2 Smash Atk Dice
1 class lighter | -1 Smash Atk Dice
2 class lighter | -2 Smash Atk Dice

Immovable Barriers are all Heavyweight.
