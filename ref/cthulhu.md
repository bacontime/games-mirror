## Phases

1. **Action Phase:** 
    - Take turns spending power to take actions.
        - -1: Recruit a dude in a space with one of your units. *(-1 power)*
        - -3:Create a Gate in a space with a dude. *(-3 power)*
        - -?: Summon a Monster. *(-? power)*
        - -?: Awaken a GOO. *(-? power)*
        - -1: Move a unit. *(-1 power)*
        - -1: Start a battle. *(-1 power)*
        - -1: Capture an unprotected dude. *(-1 power)*
    - Freely move your dudes on or off Gates.
    - If you've accomplished all 6 of your goals, you can start as many battles as you want on your turn, but only one per area on the board.
2. **Gather Power Phase:**
    - +1 per dude.
    - +2 per Gate you control.
    - +1 per Abandoned Gate (everybody gets it)
    - +1 Power for each captured dude. (Return them to their owner)
    - Bonus power based on ablities.
    - Make sure each player has at least half (rounded up) as much power as the player with the most.
3. **Determine First Player**
    - Give first player token to the player with the most power.
        - Tiebreaker is previous round's First Player.  
        - (Before the game begins, choose starting player randomly, but Cthulhu player gets dibs.)
    - That player decides whether the round goes clockwise or widdershins.
4. **Doom Phase:** (Doom is points.)
    - Each player gains 1 ~~point~~ Doom for each Gate they control.
    - Each player can choose to pay power to do a Ritual of Annihilation. If they do:
        - They gain another 1 ~~point~~ Doom per gate they control.
        - They get +1 Elder Sign for each GOO they have in play.
    - Check for the end of the game.

## Combat

You can only start combat if you can roll at least one combat dice. A little dude can't do a fight on his own.

1. Pre-battle abilities (order goes attacker, defender, bystanders)
2. Roll combat dice at the same time.
3. Apply the results to attackers then defenders
    - Any **6**s rolled kills an enemy.
    - Any **4**s and **5**s _pain_ an enemy, meaning they have to retreat to an adjacent space.
        - A unit can't retreat to a space with units of the faction they just fought.
        - If there is nowhere to retreat, one of the pained units is killed, and the rest just stay put.
    - Players get to choose which of their units are killed and pained.  


## Game End

At the end of the Doom Step, the **Game Ends** if either
    - The ritual track is at the end.
    - A player has at least 30 ~~points~~ Doom

The game can also end immediately during the the Action Phase if a player reveals Elder Signs to bring their ~~points~~ Doom to 30.

To win the game, you need to have accomplished all 6 of your objectives.   
Among the players who have done so, then the one with the most ~~points~~ Doom wins.
