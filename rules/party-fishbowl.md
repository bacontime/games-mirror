## Rules

- Divide into two teams.
- Everybody writes five or so words on scraps of paper or cards. Mix them up.
- Taking turns, each person draws cards and has 60 seconds to get their team to guess as many as possible. 
  - When your team guesses correctly, claim that card. Your team gets a point.
- Once the whole deck has been claimed: Mix up the same set of cards for the next round, and repeat.
- Each round has a different restriction on clues:
  1. Describe the thing without using its name.
  2. Describe the thing using exactly one word.
  3. Describe the thing using no words at all, only gestures (charades).

## Variants

### Secret Optional Forbidden Bonus Rounds:

- Describe the thing only by point at objects in the room.
- Describe the thing using only sounds. No words or gestures. (Hide behind a sofa.)
- Describe the thing using only one sound. No words or gestures.
- Hide your head behind a sofa, and gesture only with your hands. (Alt: one hand; feet.)
- Hide your body behind a sofa, and use only facial expressions.
- Ghost charades. Throw a sheet over yourself.
- Freeze-frame charades. Team closes eyes, you strike a pose and say "open". You can't move until your team guesses correctly.
- Puppet charades. Move another player's body into a pose to represent the word.

### Cooperative Variant

- Everyone is on the same team.
- Each person has two minutes and only gives clues once.
- If any cards remain un-guessed at the end of a round, you all lose.
