- 2 teams of 2. Teammates sit across from each other.
- Deal 13 cards to each player. (No Jokers.)
- After dealing, a player can **boast** that they will go out first.
- Person with <span class="cC">3♣︎</span> leads first.
- Scoring at the end of each hand:
    - +100 points for a sucessful boast. -100 for a failed boast.
    - If both members of a team went out before either member of the other, 
        - then +200 points for that team.
    - Otherwise,
        - The last to go out gives the rest of their hand to the other team.
        - The last to go out gives their *taken* cards to the first to go out.
        - Each team scores +5 points for each taken <span class="card">5</span>, +10 for each <span class="card">10</span>, and +10 for each <span class="card">K</span>.
