A set of Mahjong tiles is essentially just a really thick deck of cards. A Chinese set, which is what I have, consists of:

- Four copies of each of the following:
  - A suit of coins, from 1 to 9.
  - A suit of strings of coins, (sometimes called bamboo) from 1 to 9.
  - A suit of myriads, from 1 to 9.
  - Tiles for North, South, East, and West.
  - Tiles for Red, Green, and White Dragons.
- And also 8 distinct tiles representing flowers or seasons.


In addition to the games linked below, a set of Mahjong tiles is suited to playing [3 player Crew](https://www.robertmwinslow.com/games/rules/tricktaking-thecrew-variants.html#3-player-challenge-variant-mahjong-compatible)
