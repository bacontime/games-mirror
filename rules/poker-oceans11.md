# Ocean's Eleven


- Each Player takes a Deck of Cards.
- Each duel:
    1. Both players start by flipping a card.
    2. Each player forms the best poker-hand they can from their flipped cards.
    3. The player with the worse poker hand chooses one of the following:
        - Flip over another card. The duel then returns to step 2.
        - Concede. The duel ends and the other player scores a point.
- First player to 6 points wins.
- Discard your cards between each duel. Never reshuffle. If your deck is out of cards, you have likely lost.


## Three Player Variant

- Play to 4 points.
- Go around the table, taking turns flipping or conceding. 
    - Player with the best hand is the "poobah" and holds (skip them; they neither flip nor concede).
    - (This method is easier than determining the worst hand after each flip.)
- A player wins a point when both others have conceded.


<!--Todo: Try variant where you get a point if *anyone* concedes. You don't need best hand; just not the worst.-->
