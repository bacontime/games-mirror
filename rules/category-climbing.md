# Climbing / Shedding Games

## Basic Rules

- Each player is dealt a hand of cards.
- The lead plays a valid pattern of cards from their hand.
- Subsequent players must either:
    - Play the same pattern but of higher rank.
    - Pass.
    - Play a Bomb. This outranks all non-bomb plays.
- Play can continue multiple times around the table like this.
- If all but one players pass in a row, then the last player to not pass takes all cards played, places them facedown, and leads with another pattern. 
- The goal typically involves being the first to play out all your cards.

## Typical Valid Patterns:

- **Single**: <span class="card">A</span>, **Double**: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>, or **Triple**: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>
- **Full House**: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">J</span><span class="card">J</span> or **Three-and-One**: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">J</span>
- **Runs** of any of the above. 
  - Runs must have at least 5 cards. (5+ singles, 3+ pairs, etc.)
  - Ex: <span class="card">5</span><span class="card">5</span><span class="card">5</span><span class="card">J</span> <span class="card">6</span><span class="card">6</span><span class="card">6</span><span class="card">Q</span>
- **Bombs**: Four of a Kind: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>, or a pair of Jokers: <span class="card">⭑</span><span class="card">⭒</span>

2 cards are often treated as the high card, even above Aces, in this kind of game.

This means that the ranking for individual cards is ⭒⭑2AKQJT9876543, highest-to-lowest.
