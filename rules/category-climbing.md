# Climbing / Shedding Games

- Each player is dealt a hand of cards.
- The lead plays a valid pattern of cards from their hand.
- Subsequent players must either:
    - Play the same pattern but of higher rank.
    - Pass.
    - Play a Bomb. This outranks all non-bomb plays.
- Play can continue multiple times around the table like this.
- If all but one players pass in a row, then the last player to not pass takes all cards played, places them facedown, and leads with another pattern.
- Typical Valid Patterns:
    - Single: <span class="card">A</span>, Double: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>, or Triple: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>
    - Full House: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">J</span><span class="card">J</span> or Three-and-One: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">J</span>
    - Runs of any of the above. (Runs of singles must have at least 5 cards.)
      - Ex: <span class="card">5</span><span class="card">5</span><span class="card">5</span><span class="card">J</span> <span class="card">6</span><span class="card">6</span><span class="card">6</span><span class="card">Q</span>
    - **Bombs**: Four of a Kind: <span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span><span class="card">A</span>, or a pair of Jokers: <span class="card">⭑</span><span class="card">⭒</span>

The goal typically involves being the first to play out all your cards.
