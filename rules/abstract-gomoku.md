Five-in-a-Row is a simple game.

- Take turns placing stones onto a grid.
- Black places a stone, then white, then black...
- Place five stones in a row and you've won.
    - (Winning rows may be diagonal.)


## Variants

### Connect6

- Black starts by placing 1 stone.
- After that, players alternate placing two stones at a time.
- 6 in a Row is required to win.


### Yavalax

- Black starts by placing 1 stone.
- After that, players alternate placing two stones at a time.
- To win, make two simultaneous 4-in-a-rows.
- You can never make a 4-in-a-row unless you make two simultaneously.
- You can never make a 5-in-a-row.


### Pente

- Pairs of stones can be captured by capping them on either end. 
    - EG `XOOX` results in the two O pieces being captured.
    - Exactly two stones are captured. Longer or shorter lines are safe.
    - Remove captured pieces from the board.
    - You can place stones back in the empty space without getting them captured.
        - EG Placing an `O` in `XO_X` is safe. 
- You win with either a five-in-a-row or five captures (ten captured stones).


### Connect 4

Connect 4 is played with a vertical "board",
such that pieces fall to the bottom.
but can also easily be played on an actual flat board.

- Designate one side of the board as "bottom".
- Placed pieces are 'dropped' to the bottom-most empty row within their column.
- You win with four-in-row, checked only after pieces have 'settled'.
