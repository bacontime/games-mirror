- Give each player a set of four cards, all the same rank, from each of the four suits.
- The player's spade card is their **Skull**.
- Each hand:
    1. Each player plays an initial card face-down
    2. Players take turns. They can either:
        - Play another card face-down on top of theirs
        - End this phase by making a bid
    3. Players bid for how many cards they can flip.
    4. The highest bidder must flip over that many cards, starting by flipping over their own.
        - If any flipped cards are Skulls, the flipper permanently loses a card from their hand.
            - If they hit their own skull, they choose which card.
            - If someone else's skull, discard at random.
        - If no Skulls are flipped, that player earns a point!
        - Either way, that player starts the next round.
- 2 points to win.
