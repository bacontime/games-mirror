## Setup a Round:

- Deal each player six cards facedown.
  - Arrange your cards in a 3x2 grid: 3 columns, 2 rows
  - Flip two of your cards
- Flip one card to start the communal discard.

## Each Turn:

1. Draw a card from the deck or from the discard pile.
2. Either:
    - Discard that card, or
    - Replace one of your cards.
      - The replacement is played face-up.
      - The old card goes to the discard face-up.

## End-of-round Scoring:

The round ends if any player has all cards face-up.

- Pip cards score face value
- Kings: 0 points
- Queens or Jacks: +10 points
- Jokers: -2 points
- If two cards in a column have the same rank, they both score 0 points instead.

## End of Game

Play 9 rounds. Lowest score wins.
