## Basic Rules

- Everyone plays with face-up hands.
- Each player antes one chip and is dealt one card.
- After that, play always passes to whoever has the *worst hand*.
- When you play, ante X (0-4) chips. Then draw cards one at a time.
  - If you draw X cards, and still have the lowest hand, you are out.
  - If at any point you no longer have the lowest hand, stop flipping. (You don't get the extra cards. No refunds.)
- Hand limit of 5 cards.


## "Casino" Rules

- One player, the dealer, acts as the house.
- Each player antes one chip. But dealer is dealt five cards, and other players two cards.
- If dealer's hand is too high, dealer folds. See below.
- From worst hand to best, each player has one play and chooses whether to:
  - fold
  - ante one chip to buy exactly three cards.
- If a player's full hand is good enough, the dealer pays a bonus to them, even if they lose.

| Non-dealers | Dealer Fold Threshold |
|:-:|:-:|
| 2 | AAQ |
| 3 | TTxx |
| 4 | AAxx |
| 5 | 222 |
| 6 | QQQ |
| 7 | A2345 |

| Bonus Hand | Chip Bonus |
|:-:|:-:|
| Straight | 2 |
| Flush | 5 |
| Full House | 10 |
| Four of a Kind | 25 |
| Straight Flush | 100 |
| Royal Flush | 1000 |

If playing at home, cap bonuses at 10, and rotate role of dealer.
