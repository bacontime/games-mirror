- On your turn, either:
    - Place a stone on its own to start a new group.
    - Grow all your groups by **exactly** one stone.
        - A new stone touching two groups counts as having grown both.
        - You can also merge two groups by growing them both such that only the new stones touch.
- Game ends when the board is full.
- Your score is #Stones - (#Groups * 4)
