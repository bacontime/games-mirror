- A hand of 10 cards is played, then a hand of 9, then 8, etc., all the way down to 1.
- If there enough time in the evening, we then play back up to 10.
- Within each hand:
    - The trump suit is determined randomly.
    - Each player bids how many tricks they think they will take.
    - At the end of each hand, points are scored:
        - 1 point for each trick taken.
        - 10 Bonus points if you matched your bid exactly.
- In the hand with only 1 card dealt, we play a round of Devil's Poker.
