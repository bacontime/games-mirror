## Basic Adaptation

- Dragons are wild, and can be zero or 10 in runs.
- Winds are skips I guess. Or maybe they're nothing but are worth zero points in hand.

It'd work fine. Fiiiiiine.




## Other Rules Tweaks

This adopts some of the rules from  other releases of phase 10.


### Playing Phases in any order.

Make a Grid where the rows represent each phase, and the columns represent each player.
Instead of proceeding through the phases in order, players can choose which phase to tackle each round.

At the beginning of each round:
1. Players look at their hands.
2. Players decide which phase to tackle
    - They can't change their mind mid round
    - They can't choose a phase they've already sucessfully completed.
3. Then the round begins.


### Multiple Discard Piles

[Phase 10 Twist](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38187/phase-10-twist) has three discard piles.
It also some some convulted boardstate thingy.



### Other

In Continental Rummy, players can buy the top discard at any time but taking extra penalty cards?
