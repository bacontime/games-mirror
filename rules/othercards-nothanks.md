Game is played with 2-10 in 4 suits. 
Remove the Aces and Faces.

- Give each player 13 chips.
- Randomly remove 7 cards.
- Each turn, the active player either:
    - Places a chip on the active card to avoid taking it.
    - OR takes the active card and the chips on it, and flips a new card.
- After all cards have been taken, scoring:
    - Each card scores its face value plus a suit-dependent bonus:
      - <span class="cD">♦︎</span> scores +0; 
      - Each <span class="cS">♠︎</span> +10; 
      - Each <span class="cH">♥︎</span> +20; 
      - Each  <span class="cC">♣︎</span> +30
    - If you have a mono-suit run of cards, only score the lowest card in the run.
    - Each chip is -1 Point.
- *Fewest* points wins.
