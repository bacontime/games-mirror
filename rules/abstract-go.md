1. The board is empty at the start of the game (unless players agree to place a handicap).
2. Black makes the first move, after which White and Black alternate.
3. A move consists of placing one stone of one's own color onto an empty intersection on the board.
4. A player may pass their turn at any time.
5. A stone or orthogonally connected group of stones of one color is captured and removed from the board when all the intersections orthogonally adjacent to it are occupied by the enemy. *(Capture of the enemy takes precedence over self-capture.)*
6. No stone may be played so as to recreate a former board position.
7. Two consecutive passes end the game.
8. A player's territory consists of all the board intersections he has either occupied or surrounded.
9. The player with more territory wins. White wins ties.


Traditionally, the game is played on a 19x19 grid,
but can easily be played on a smaller grid for a shorter game.

In games between equally skilled players, white is typically given *7.5* bonus points
to compensate for first-player advantage.

These Rules are copied, with slight modification, [from Robert Jasiek's page here](http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/element.html). 

Jasiek in turn says the following:

> The original version of these rules by James Davies was first published in "The Rules and Elements of Go", The Ishi Press, 1977. I have added slight modifications for more clarity. The rules use a language that is easy for beginners. The concept is simplicity and logic based on [super ko](http://home.snafu.de/jasiek/superko.html) and area counting. The rules were inspired by the Taiwanese 1974 rules and are close to [Tromp-Taylor 1996](https://web.archive.org/web/20120305163449/homepages.cwi.nl/~tromp/go.html) and New Zealand 1975 rules.
