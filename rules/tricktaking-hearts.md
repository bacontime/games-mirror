# Hearts

*Good for teaching the concept of trick-taking.*


- There is no trump suit.
- Each hand, the entire deck is dealt out. 13 cards to each player.
- Each player passes three cards to their left/right/opposite/no-pass. The direction changes each hand.
- Within a hand, hearts cannot be played as lead suit until at least one heart has already been played.
- End-of-hand:
    - Earn +1 point for each <span class="cH">♥&#xFE0E;</span> card you have taken.
    - Earn +13 points for taking <span class="cS">Q♠&#xFE0E;</span>
    - Shooting the moon: If you took all 13 <span class="cH">♥&#xFE0E;</span> and the <span class="cS">Q♠&#xFE0E;</span>, then instead:
        - Earn -26 points, OR
        - Give each other player +26 points.
    - Game ends if a player now has 100+ points.
- Player with the fewest points wins.
