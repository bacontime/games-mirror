*Dad is freakishly good at this.*

- Deal 4 cards to each player.
- Each turn:
    - Flip four cards from the deck into a pool.
    - Each player plays a card from their hand, face down, and reveals simultaneously.
    - In order from highest played card to lowest, each player:
        - Takes all cards from the pool that match the rank *or* suit of their card.
        - Places their card into the pool.
    - All cards left in the pool are discarded.
- Turns continue until the deck runs out.
- Players use the cards in their hand to form a single poker hand of 5 cards.
