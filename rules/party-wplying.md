- Designate one person as judge.
- Everyone else finds a wikipedia article and spends a couple minutes reading it.
  - They can choose an article they think would be funny, [or pick one at random](../tools/randomwiki).
  - If you pick a random one, you may need to re-roll a few times and exercise some judgement. 
- Write down the titles of the article on scraps of paper and shuffle them up.
- The judge now picks one at random, and reads the title aloud.
- Everyone wants to convince the judge that they are the one who just read that article.
- The judge wins if they guess correctly. Other people win if the judge guesses them.



<!--
- Maybe try picking one with a one-word title. Or perhaps writing down only the last name for people?
Don't write down parentheticals?
