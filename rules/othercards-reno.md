*Works fine. Made a few tweaks and need to replay.*



- Each player gets 8 dice of their color and 2 neutral dice.
- Deal Out 6 stacks of cards on the table:
    - Deal cards to a stack until the cards add up to at least 10 in total.
    - Arrange each stack from highest to lowest.
- Each turn:
    - Roll all dice in your pool.
    - Choose a number you rolled.
    - All your dice which rolled that number are played to the cooresponding stack.
- Once all dice are played out:
    - For each stack, the player with the most dice takes the highest card.
    - The player with the second-most takes the second highest, etc.
    - Ties cancel each other out.
    - The neutral color can win cards and tie with players.
- After four rounds, score:
    - <span class="card">J</span>, <span class="card">Q</span>, and <span class="card">K</span> are worth 11, 12, and 13, respectively.
    - <span class="card">A</span> are worth 1 point but are placed at the top of stacks.
    - All other cards are worth their face value.
