# Spades


- 2 teams of 2. Each person sits across from their teammate.
- Spades are always the trump suit.
- Each hand, the entire deck is dealt out. 13 cards to each player.
- Each player bids how many tricks they think they will take. Teammate's bids are combined.
- **Breaking spades:**  Within a hand, spades cannot be played as lead suit until at least one spade has already been played.
- End-of-hand scoring:
    - If team's bid is met or exceeded: +10×[bid]
    - If team's bid is not met: -10×[bid]
    - For each trick taken in excess of team bid: +1 point and +1 **bag**:
        - Bags accumulate across hands.
        - Every 7th bag results in -100 points.
    - Special case: If a player bids 0
        - Any tricks that player earns are counted as bags instead of contributing to their teams total.
        - If that player takes exactly 0 tricks, their team earns +100 points
    - **Shooting the Moon**: If a team bids 13 and succeeds, they earn +200 points instead of +130
- First team to 300 points wins.
