- Set aside and shuffle the diamonds. These will be bid on.
- Give each player one of the other suits. All thirteen cards.
- Each turn:
  - Flip over a diamond card.
  - All players bid a card from their hand face down.
  - Flip the cards. Highest bid wins the diamond(s).
  - If there is a tie, neither wins. Leave the diamond in the pot. Next turn bid for multiple diamond cards. 
- Winner is the one with the most diamond points at the end.

Aces are worth 1 for both bidding and scoring. Jacks 11, Queens 12, Kings 13.

(There are 91 points total, so 46 is enough to ensure a win.)
