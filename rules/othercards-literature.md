# Literature

*Like Go Fish, but more so.*

For 6 (3 teams of 2) or 8 (2 teams of 4) players.


## Setup

Remove the 8 cards from a 52-card deck.

The deck now consists of eight "half-suits" of six cards each:
the High cards (9 10 J Q K A) and Low cards (2 3 4 5 6 7) of each suit.

Deal the entire deck evenly.

## Each Turn:

- On your turn,you may ask an opponent for a specific card, by suit and value.
- To ask for a card:
    - You must be holding another card from that half-suit
    - You must ask for a card which you are not holding.
    - You have an opponent who still has cards.
- Before or after asking for a card, you may claim a half-suit
    - You can claim a half-suit if you have all six cards in hand.
    - Or you may claim it if you believe your team collectively has all six cards
        - But if you are wrong about this, the other team gets the half suit


## Endgame

- Once a player has no cards, they are skipped.
- If the current player runs out of cards because of a claim, they can pass the turn to a teammate.
- The team with the most half-suits wins.
