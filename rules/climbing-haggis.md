## Special Rules


- Shuffle the pip cards (2-10) and deal 14 to each player.
- Also give each player one Jack, one Queen, and one King face up. These are wild.
- Before cards are played, a player can make a bet for 0, 15, or 30 points. They will win the bet if they are the one to play out all their cards.
- If a bomb tops a trick, then the other player captures the cards.
  - The person who played the bomb still gets to start the next trick.
  - They just don't capture the cards from the trick.
- Once one player has played all their cards, score.

## Scoring

- 5 points for each card left in your opponent's hand.
- Points for cards captured from tricks:
  - Odds (3,5,7,9) score 1 points each.
  - Jacks score 2 points.
  - Queens score 3.
  - Kings score 5.
- If you won your bet, you get that many points. If you lost, then your opponent gets those points.

Multiple rounds may be played. Suggested winning total is 250.

<!--Also you capture the haggis and your opponent's hand if you go out first?-->

(Up to 7 of a kind using the wild cards.)
- **Runs** of sets. 
  - Runs must have at least **3** cards. (3+ singles, 2+ pairs, etc.)
  - Each set in the run must be composed of the same suit(s).
- Wild cards (<span class="card">J</span><span class="card">Q</span><span class="card">K</span>) may be used to stand in for any suit and any lower rank.
