# Slither

*Shuffle pieces around to form them into a big blob.*

## Winning
Black wants to form a path of orthogonally-connected stones linking the top to the bottom of the board.  
white wants to form such a path linking the left and right of the board.

## Moves

1. (optional) Move one of your stones to an adjacent space, diagonally or orthogonally.
2.  Place one of your stones on an empty space.

No bare diagonals: After your move, two allied stones can't be diagonally adjacent unless both are orthogonally adjacent to the same third stone.

```
Bad:            Fine:
    XO                  XX
    OX                  OX
```

## Optional Advanced variant:

You can only move a stone if it's orthogonally adjacent to an allied stone.
