# Ship's Crew 

*Cooperative mission-based trick-taking for 2-5*

Players
: 2-5 (variants for 2,3,5)

Deck
: 2-10 in 4 suites, + 4 trumps;

Task Deck
: Second deck with no trumps;  

Equipment
: Tokens for communication and tasks 

## Rules

### Goal of the Game: **Fulfill All Tasks**

- Tasks are distributed among players face-up
    - A task is fulfilled if its owner takes the trick with the cooresponding cards.
    - A mission is failed if a task is taken by the wrong player.
    - A mission is immediately won if all tasks are fulfilled.
- At the start of a mission:
    - Some tasks are dealt face-up into the middle of the table.
    - The *Captain* is the player dealt the highest trump.
    - Starting with the Captain, players choose tasks.
    - Captain leads first trick.
- Some missions have additional conditions attached to tasks as they are drawn and marked by task tokens.


### Communication

- You can't talk about your cards. Except for the following
- Once per mission, between tricks, communicate:
    1. Show everyone a non-trump card from your hand
    2. Tell people whether it is:
        - Your *highest* card of that suit
        - Your *lowest* card of that suit
        - Your *only* card of that suit
