This game uses a deck with cards 2-10 in 4 suites, in addition to 4 trump cards.
It also requires the use of a second "Task Deck" with no trumps,
and assorted tokens for communication and tasks.



## Rules

### Goal of the Game: **Fulfill All Tasks**

- Tasks are distributed among players face-up
    - A task is fulfilled if its owner takes the trick with the cooresponding cards.
    - A mission is failed if a task is taken by the wrong player.
    - A mission is immediately won if all tasks are fulfilled.
- At the start of a mission:
    - Some tasks are dealt face-up into the middle of the table.
    - The *Captain* is the player dealt the highest trump.
    - Starting with the Captain, players choose tasks.
    - Captain leads first trick.
- Some missions have additional conditions attached to tasks as they are drawn and marked by task tokens.


### Communication

- You can't talk about your cards. Except for the following
- Once per mission, between tricks, communicate:
    1. Show everyone a non-trump card from your hand
    2. Tell people whether it is:
        - Your *highest* card of that suit
        - Your *lowest* card of that suit
        - Your *only* card of that suit
