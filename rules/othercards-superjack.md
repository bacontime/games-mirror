# Superjack

*An attempt to adapt MtG to a standard deck of cards.*

Decks
: 40 card deck for each player.  
Use 2-7,J,Q,K,A. Remove 8,9,10,Jokers.  
One player plays with <span class="cD">♦︎</span>s and <span class="cS">♠︎</span>s.  
Other plays with <span class="cH">♥︎</span>s and <span class="cC">♣︎</span>s.

## Basic Ideas

- Same core rules as Magic: the Gathering
- Each Player starts with 20 life and 5 cards in hand.
- Land is Pip cards (2-7). They each tap for one mana of their color.
- Creatures are Aces and Faces (A,J,Q,K).
- An Ace can also be played as a spell.
- If a creature is summoned using mana from a straight of lands, then that creature enters with haste and evasion.
- There are additional instant-speed actions you can take:
  - **Sacrifice**: Tap and sac a land to activate a special ability.
  - **Straights**: Combine lands to produce special effects.
  - **Pairs**: Equip lands to a creature to boost power/toughness.
  - **Royal Sacrifice**: Tap a set of royals and sac the Jack to destroy target creature.


## Special Land Abilities

### Sacrifice Actions

Tap and sacrifice a land to activate one of the following abilities, based on the rank of that land:

<span class="card">2</span> or <span class="card">3</span>
: Fireball 🔥. Deal 2 damage to target creature or 1 damage to target player.

<span class="card">4</span> or <span class="card">5</span>
: Mine ⛏️. Add 3 mana of that land's color.

<span class="card">6</span> or <span class="card">7</span>
: Draw a card.


### Tapping Straights

Simultaneously tap a straight of land cards. Instead of adding mana, you may activate an ability based on the length of the straight:

3 cards
: Gain +1 life

4 cards
: Draw a card, then discard a card.
<!--Desolate Lighthouse-->

5 cards
: Sacrifice one of the lands in this straight. If you do, return a creature from your graveyard to play.

6 cards
: Sacrifice one of the lands in this straight. If you do, gain control of target creature an opponent controls.


### Pairs

Tap a pair of same-color lands to **equip** that pair to a creature until the beginning of your next turn. This improves that creatures power and toughness as long as the pair is equipped.

- One pair gives +1/+1
- Two pairs give +2/+2
- 4 of a Kind instead gives +3/+3

A creature may not have more than 4 cards equipped this way.



## Creatures

### Summoning a Creature

A creature's cost must be paid using mana of that creature's color. (Each player should have two different colors of cards.)

Instead of summoning an Ace, you may cast it as a spell.

#### Royal Charge

If the lands tapped to pay for a creature form a straight, then that creature gains Haste and "This creature can only be block by creatures of its own type." until end of turn.

### Creature Stats

#### King
- 5 mana
- 3/3

#### Queen
- 4 mana
- 2/2

#### Jack
- 2 mana
- 1/1
- Stacking:
  - *At instant speed, you may combine two or more Jacks into a Stack.*
  - *Each Jack in the Stack doubles its stats.*
  - *Alas, Jacks in the Stack cannot be unstacked.*
  - *If more than one additional Jack has been added to the Stack this turn, then that Stack regains summoning sickness.* 
  <!--- *To attack with the Stack, you tap all the Jacks.*-->
  - *A Stack with 4 or more Jacks is a **Superjack** and gains Trample*

#### Superjack
- A Stack with 4 Jacks
- 8/8
- Trample

#### Ace (Creature)
- 3 mana 
- 1/1 
- Flash, Haste

#### Ace (Spell)
- 3 mana
- Instant
- Choose one:
  - Destroy target land.
  - Counter target Ace. *(You may counter an Ace being played as either a creature or a spell.)*

### Royal Sacrifice

At instant speed, tap a Jack, a Queen, and a King all of one color; and sacrifice that Jack. If you do, destroy target creature.

Game found on reddit. [Full rules here.](https://www.superjackthegame.com/). <!--Technically, this ruleset is a bit offkilter because the original uses red and black for colors. So if you steal an opponent's creature, you can use it in a royal sacrifice. Oh well.-->
