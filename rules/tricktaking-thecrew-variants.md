## 2-player Variant: Bubbles the Monkey

A third dummy player, named Bubbles, is simulated with two rows of cards.

### Setup:

1. Set aside the highest trump.
2. Build Bubbles' hand from the other 39 cards:
   1. Deal a row of 7 cards face-down
   2. Deal a second row of 7 face-up on top of it.
3. Shuffle the top trump back in and deal 13 cards to each player.
4. Captain chooses tasks for Bubbles

### During play:

- The Captain chooses which face-up card to play on Bubbles' turn
- A face-down card is flipped after the card on top of it is played.




## 3-player Challenge Variant: Mahjong-compatible

Make things tougher for three by playing with only three suits.

- Remove all cards and tasks from one of the suits.
- Remove the lowest trump card.





## 5-player Variant: Helping Hand

On certain missions (starting with #25), you can collectively decide to let one player foist off a task onto another player.
