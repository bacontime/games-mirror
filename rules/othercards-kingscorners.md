*Fond memories of playing this with Grandma.*

- Ace is low.
- Setup:
    - Deal 7 cards to each player.
    - Flip four cards to make N, S, E, and W piles.
- On your turn, make any number of the following moves:
    - Play a card from hand onto a pile.
        - The card played must be next lowest in rank, and opposite in color to the one it's played onto.
    - Play a king from hand to an empty corner space to stat start a NE, SE, NW, or SW pile.
    - Move an entire pile onto another
        - the bottom card of the moving pile must be a rank lower and opposite color to the top of the other pile
    - Play any card to an empty N, S, E, or W pile
- After moving, 
    - if your hand is empty, you win!
    - Otherwise, draw a card.
