# Game Rules and Tools

This site has 
rules blurbs for games
I know how to play,
as well as a few assorted little widgets.
Card games should be assumed to use a standard 52 card deck unless otherwise mentioned. 

## Quick Links

- [Poker Hand ranking chart](rules/category-poker), along with a list of games that use poker hands.
- [My Board Game Collection](ref/bgcollection.html), with the ability to sort by rules complexity and language dependence.

## Related Sites

- [Pagat](https://www.pagat.com/) is a fantastic website, which hundreds of in-depth rulesets for all sorts of card games, but it can be a bit *too* much. Sometimes I don't need  an in-depth history of the game, with fifteen different variants and a detailed explanation of the regionally-favored shuffling technique. Sometimes I just want some bullet points reminding me how to score.
- Kevan Davis' [Freeze-dried Game Pack](https://kevan.org/fdgp/index.php), which has rules for games in 100 words or less.
